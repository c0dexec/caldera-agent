# About project
- Create an AI agent that can perform user's tasks through the use of Caldera's API.
## Work plan
- Implement OpenAPI v2 ingestion and suppliment it as context.
    - To provide better output and reduce the need to make same API calls over and over again.
- Implement payload uploading capabilities.

# Blockers/Limitations
- Need to understand how I can make use of Utilies and tools provided and add context to them
    - If not possible then might have to go with multi-model approach
- Because of constraints of free API calls, I have to self host the model.
